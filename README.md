# Used-phone-e-market
# Project
You must create an e-market where subscribed users sell used mobile phones.

A new user is registered to the system (username, password, email) 
and then log-ins. 

You should ask the user to activate his account be clicking on a link that you will send him after registration to his email (you can skip activation if you find it hard).

After login land the registered user in his "own page" where he will be able to insert a single mobile phone details (insert mode), or view the data he entered in the past and modify them (update mode). In update mode, provide a button to completely delete the mobile and its images (see #4). The fields to describe the mobile: brand, model, screen size, RAM size, storage size, color, price.

All the form elements must be equipped with the right attributes (if possible) to help the user give proper input. Additionally a (simple) JavaScript form validator must be also implemented.

The registered user should be able to upload as many photos of the phone as he likes (and delete any of them if he wants).

The end user should be able to search for mobiles using a search form with at least 5 criteria (brand, model, RAM size, screen size, price range) â€“ or less if you cannot do it like this!

The search results should be displayed paginated with 4-6 results per page. You must have enough data in the database to demonstrate pagination.

By clicking on a search result you should display the full phone details and images in a dedicated page.

The home page must be the search page but should be enhanced with a few static and pre-fabricated queries, in the form of html links (like "Cheap iPhones", "For Gaming", etc).
